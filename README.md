# Stochastic Processes in Finance

## Overview

This repository presents a python option pricing library, built with the code encountered in the sequence of notebooks (see notebooks). These notebooks are my way of familiarising myself with quant environments. Each notebook is clearly structured, so that it is easy for other people to follow along as I familiarize myself with concepts from books such as Stochastic Calculus for finance -Shreve, Options, futurus and derivatives -Hull, Monte carlo methods.
