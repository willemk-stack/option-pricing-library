To do this, we consider an investor who holds a portfolio consisting of $\\Delta_t$ units of the stock and some amount in the risk-free asset (bond or bank account). By choosing $\\Delta_t$ appropriately, we can construct a self-financing portfolio that replicates the option’s payoff. No-arbitrage then implies that the value of this replicating portfolio must equal the option price at all times.
